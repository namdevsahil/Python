Que 1) How can we store a single quote (‘) as a string in a variable?
Ans =  s = "i don't like"
 print(s)       //"i don't like"

Que 2) Refer the below variable:
x = ‘a'
Here, is x a character type or string type variable? Support your answer w1th an explanation.
Ans  = The variable x, assigned the value 'a', is a string type variable in Python. In Python, a single character enclosed in single or double quotes is still treated as a string. So, even though 'a' contains only one character, it is considered a string.
In this case, x is a string variable holding the character 'a'. If you were to check the type of x using the type() function in Python.

Que 3) Apply the following functions on this variable: ‘Welcome to Python foundation course'
find ()
count()
len()
Concatenation
Ans = # Given string
x = 'Welcome to Python foundation course'


# 1. find()
find_result = x.find('Python')
print("find result:- ", find_result)


# 2. count()
count_result = x.count('')
print("count result:- ",count_result)


# 3. len()
length_result = len(x)
print("length result:- ",length_result)


# 4. Concatenation
concatenation_result = x + ' - Advanced Topics'
print("concatination result:- ", concatenation_result)



Que 4) For the variable: word = ‘PanaJi@122566’
  Calculate the following:
Total number of alphabets in lowercase
Total number of alphabets in uppercase
Total number of numerical in string 
Ans = x = "PanaJi@12256"
lowercase_count = x.islower()
print(lowercase_count)


uppercase_count = x.isupper()
print(uppercase_count)


numerical_count = x.isalnum()
print(numerical_count)

Que 5) Write a code to store a numerical value inside a variable then convert it into string.
Ans = #convert the numerical value to a string
string_value = str(numerical_value)
print("original numerical value: ", numerical_value)
print("Converted String Value: ", string_value)


print(type(string_value))
print(type(numerical_value))
