Assignment

Que 1) Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.
Ans = A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Que 2) What will happen if we declare a restricted keyword as a variable?
Ans = It makes the compiler's life hard. If keywords were allowed as variable names, it would be very hard to tell (for the developers and the compilers) whether something was a variable or a keyword.

Que 3) Can we  actually declare a  string as a  variable name?
Ans = While Python does not directly allow you to convert a string into a variable name.

Que 4) Is it possible for us to declare “_” as a variable? If so, then write an example of it?
Ans = The underscore character ( _ ) can also appear in a name
Ex - my_name

Que 5) Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.
Ans = Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime. Due to strong typing, types need to be compatible with respect to the operand when performing operations. For example Python allows one to add an integer and a floating point number, but adding an integer to a string produces error.
